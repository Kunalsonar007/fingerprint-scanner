## Description

Heyy Friends, In this tutorial we will create a dummy fingerprint scanner using CSS. <br>Here we will add a basic fingerprint scanner animation effect without any hovering effect.

Our fingerprint scanner will have a basic animation, a bar will move top to down like any other scanner,<br> behind the bar there is a single image but we added :after pseudo-element so we applied a filter for blue color.<br> At the bottom, we added a scanning text with the show and hide animation.

<br>

## Steps to run in your machine

- Open your IDE and create 1 HTML file and 1 CSS file.

- Link Css file to HTML file.

- Run.
